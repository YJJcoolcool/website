			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<div id="details">
				<p id="details-left">
					I am currently studying the Diploma in Infocomm Security Management in Republic Polytechnic.<br>
					<br>
					I have always been intrested in Technology and more specifically, Programming.<br>
					<br>
					So in Secondary School, I decided to start learning Programming, gaining new and exciting skills, even making my very own website which you see right now!<br>
					<br>
					I am a person who really likes to experiment with and create stuff.</b><br>
					<br>
					I hate paying for stuff. (Most people do anyway) So all my work is open source and you can freely use anything on my website or projects without permission. That's also why I chose to make my own website, and not use some online website builder.<br>
					<i>Who likes an ugly Made by XYZ.com on their webpage anyways?</i>

						<h3>Web Design</h3>
						<p>I know HTML and CSS and I can help design websites for you.</p>
						<p>Currently I do not charge any money. Contact me if you would like me to make a website for you or your company!</p>
						<p><b>NOTE!</b> By "Design Websites", this means that I only do the Front End stuff and do not go Back End stuff (e.g. getting a domain, login system, etc.)</p>

						<h3>Google Maps Photography & 360째 Photography</h3>
						<p>I like to contribute to Google Maps and take 360째 Photography with my 360째 Camera (Samsung Gear 360)</p>
						<p>They are not the best quality like you would get from a $2000 camera, but they are still pretty decent. Hopefully I can get a better camera for more professional shots sooner or later.</p>
						<p>I am available most of the time on weekends to help do 360 Photography. <a href="./social/index.html">Contact me</a> if you would like to arrange a Photography session for your business.</p>
